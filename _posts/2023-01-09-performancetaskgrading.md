### <mark>Week 18</mark> Performance Task Grading #2

# Submission 1

| Category | My Score | College Board Score | Explanation |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 0 | Code is running, shows user input, and displays a final result. However, student did not explain the purpose of the code.|
| Data Abstraction | 0 | 0 | List described by student is not shown in program.|
| Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | List does not contain complex code. |
| Procedural Abstraction | 0 | 0 | Student fails to explain how the procedure functions| 
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 0 | Student description lacks important details about thier algorithm| 
| Testing | 1 | 1 | Student explains how the two procedures were called. | 

# Submission 2

| Category | My Score | College Board Score | Explanation |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | Video shows that code is running and functional, and student explains the purpose and functionality of the code. |
| Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | Student shows code segments and explains the function of the lists |
| Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | List  manages complexity and student talks about what would happen if the list wasn't present. |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | Student describes procedure with four different parameters and procedure is functional | 
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | Student includes sequencing, selection, and iteration in their program. | 
| Testing | 1 | 1 | Student demonstrates the results of the procedures being called. | 

# Submission 3

| Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | Student shows functional code segment and lists |
| Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | List  manages complexity and student talks about what would happen if the list wasn't present. |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | Student describes procedure with two different parameters and procedure is functional. | 
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | Algorithm includes sequencing, selection, and interation and student describes algorithm's purpose. | 
| Testing | 1 | 1 | Student demonstrates the results of the procedures being called and the specific conditions being tested in each call. | 

# Submission 4

| Category | My Score | College Board Score | Explanation |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | Video shows that code is running and functional, and student explains the purpose and functionality of the code. |
| Data Abstraction | 1 | 0 | Data stored in the list was not used in the program |
| Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 |  List was not  used in the code to manage complexity. |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | Student showed procedure with parameter and described the functioanlity of the procedure. | 
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | Algorithm includes sequencing, selection, and interation and student describes algorithm's purpose. | 
| Testing | 0 | 0 | Student described the conditions being tested, but did not explain the 2 arguments of the code execution. | 


### Reflection on Scoring
Overall, I think I had a better understanding of the College Board Rubric for Performance Tasks than last week, although I still got some scores incorrect. Most of my errors were made in the Row 1 category when the student failed to describe either functionality or purpose of their program. In the future, I will try to be more critical when scoring for Row 1 so I can catch when the student misses a requirement. This will also prevent me from making similar mistakes with my performance task in the future.
