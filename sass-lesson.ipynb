    "# Why SASS?\n",
    "\n",
    "SASS is an improvement on CSS in that there are methods of abstraction. It is a __stylesheet__ language that is __compiled__ into CSS, which means that __SASS will translate the SASS code you wrote in CSS__, which is what your web browser can read.\n",
    "\n",
    "# SASS vs SCSS\n",
    "As you learn about Sass, you might notice something called Scss. They are basically the same thing except that Scss uses curly braces and semicolons to distinguish between lines. Sass uses indentation and newlines instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be teaching the Scss syntax because it is more commonly used."

    "\n",
    "The first step is to clone a GitHub pages repo, such as this [one](https://github.com/lwu1822/sassy_squad).\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the repository, head over to `assets/css/`, and open `style.scss`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where you can create your SASS code.\n",
