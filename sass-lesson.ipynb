    "# Why SASS?\n",
    "\n",
    "SASS is an improvement on CSS in that there are methods of abstraction. It is a __stylesheet__ language that is __compiled__ into CSS, which means that __SASS will translate the SASS code you wrote in CSS__, which is what your web browser can read.\n",
    "\n",
    "# SASS vs SCSS\n",
    "As you learn about Sass, you might notice something called Scss. They are basically the same thing except that Scss uses curly braces and semicolons to distinguish between lines. Sass uses indentation and newlines instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be teaching the Scss syntax because it is more commonly used."

    "The first step is to clone a GitHub pages repo, such as this [one](https://github.com/lwu1822/sassy_squad).\n",

    "__Variables__\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most powerful features of SASS is the ability to define variables, which can be used to store values that are reused throughout your code. This can be useful for things like colors, font sizes, and spacing values. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$primary-color: #007bff;\n",
    "$font-size-base: 16px;\n",
    "$spacing: 8px;\n",
    "```\n",
    "Once you've defined a variable, you can use it anywhere in your code by referencing its name, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "button {\n",
    "  background-color: $primary-color;\n",
    "  font-size: $font-size-base;\n",
    "  padding: $spacing;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "__Partials__\n",
    "\n",
    "SASS also allows you to split your code into separate files called partials, which can then be imported into a main file. This can be useful for breaking your code up into smaller, more manageable pieces. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "// _variables.scss\n",
    "$primary-color: #007bff;\n",
    "$font-size-base: 16px;\n",
    "$spacing: 8px;\n",
    "\n",
    "// _buttons.scss\n",
    "@import \"variables\";\n",
    "\n",
    "button {\n",
    "  background-color: $primary-color;\n",
    "  font-size: $font-size-base;\n",
    "  padding: $spacing;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// main.scss\n",
    "@import \"variables\";\n",
    "@import \"buttons\";\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "__Functions__\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, SASS allows you to define your own functions, which can be used to perform calculations or transformations on values. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "@function em($px-size) {\n",
    "  @return #{$px-size / $font-size-base}em;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "h1 {\n",
    "  font-size: em(32px);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, SASS is a powerful tool for improving your CSS code by adding features like variables, nesting, partials, and functions. By using these features, you can write more maintainable and readable code, and make your CSS development process more efficient.\n",
