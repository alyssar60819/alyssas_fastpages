Identity columns help to identify each specific row of the database. This ensures that each row has its own identity column. What is the purpose of a primary key in SQL database? A primary key in a SQL database is something which can uniquely identify the row of a database. For example, the users database uses id for the primary key. For the coders, we use the uid as the primary key. What are the Data Types in SQL table? The data types in a SQL table include integers, floats, and strings."

    "The hacked part of the update function outputs a message to the user if the length of the password is too short. This serves as authentication for the user to make sure that a password is long enough for security purposes. Explain try/except, when would except occur? Try and except work as things which check if certain code is running/working. Try runs if the code is working smoothly, and in this case serves to update the password. Except occurs if there is an error with the connection and cursor with the database. This serves as a good way to check errors if there is something wrong with the code. What code seems to be repeated in each of these examples to point, why is it repeated? Code that seems to be repeated include import sqlite3, defining the conn and cursor methods, cursor execute, conn.commit(), and conn and cursor close. This code seems to be repeated because it is required to connect and use the cursor method in the database. cursor.execute() seems to run the wanted code, whether it is update, delete, read, etc. conn.commit() appears that it commits the changes to the database in order to make the changes permanent. The closing of cursor and conn appears to be present because it is important be able to close the working connections and cursors in order to be able to have different ones. This is especially important when working with servers because it makes sure to have orderly code and prevents resources from being used unnecessarily.\n"
